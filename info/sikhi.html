        <h1 id="h1sikhi">What is Sikhi ?</h1>
        <p>
            Sikhi, also known as Sikhism, is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Punjab region of South Asia during the late 15th century. It was founded by <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-nank')">Guru Nanak Dev Ji</a>, the first of ten Sikh Gurus, and is based on his teachings and those of the nine successive Gurus.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Beliefs of Sikhi:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oneness of God:</strong> Sikhs believe in one formless, timeless, and all-pervading God, referred to as Waheguru. This belief emphasizes that God is the same for all people, regardless of religion.</li>
            <li><strong>Equality:</strong> Sikhi teaches the equality of all humans, regardless of race, gender, caste, or religion. This principle is foundational, and Sikhs are encouraged to treat everyone with respect and dignity.</li>
            <li><strong>Selfless Service (Seva):</strong> Sikhs are expected to engage in seva, or selfless service, to help others and serve the community without expecting anything in return. This service can be in the form of helping others in need, volunteering, or supporting community initiatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Honest Living:</strong> Sikhs are encouraged to live honestly and earn their livelihood through hard work and integrity. This principle, known as Kirat Karni, emphasizes the importance of living a truthful and ethical life.</li>
            <li><strong>Naam Japna (Meditation on God's Name):</strong> Sikhs are encouraged to meditate on God's name and remember God at all times. This practice helps in staying spiritually connected and focused on the divine.</li>
            <li><strong>The <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib:</a>:</strong> The <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib:</a> is the central religious scripture of Sikhi. It is considered the eternal Guru by Sikhs and contains the teachings of the Sikh Gurus as well as writings from various saints and scholars of different faiths.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practices in Sikhi:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gurdwara:</strong> The Sikh place of worship is called a Gurdwara. It is open to people of all faiths and serves as a community center where Sikhs gather for prayer, service, and community meals (Langar).</li>
            <li><strong>Langar:</strong> A communal meal served in the Gurdwara, where everyone sits together and eats the same food, emphasizing equality and community spirit.</li>
            <li><strong>The Five Ks (Panji Kakar):</strong> Sikhs who are initiated into the Khalsa (a community of committed Sikhs) wear five articles of faith:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kesh:</strong> (uncut hair)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kangha:</strong> (a wooden comb)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kara:</strong> (a steel bracelet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kachera:</strong> (cotton undergarments)</li>
                    <li><strong>Kirpan:</strong> (a ceremonial sword)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Sikh Gurus:</h2>
        <p>The ten Sikh Gurus played a crucial role in shaping the religion and guiding their followers. They provided spiritual leadership and established the principles that Sikhs continue to follow today. The tenth Guru, <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-gobind')">Guru Gobind Singh Ji</a>, declared the <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib:</a> as the eternal Guru before his passing.</p>

        <h2>Sikhi Today:</h2>
        <p>Sikhi is one of the youngest major religions in the world, with millions of followers globally, particularly in Punjab, India, where it originated. Sikhs are known for their distinct identity, charitable works, and commitment to the principles laid down by their Gurus.</p>

        <h1 id="h1rag">Understanding Rāgs in <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib</a></h1>

        <h2>Definition of Rāgs:</h2>
        <p>A Rāg is a framework for musical composition and improvisation. It consists of a specific scale (a set of notes) and a set of rules that guide how these notes should be used to create a melody. <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> are designed to evoke particular emotions, such as devotion, peace, longing, or joy.</p>
    
        <h2><a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> in the <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib:</a></h2>
        <p>The <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib</a> contains 31 main <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a>, with some additional minor <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a>, in which its hymns are composed. These <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> are arranged in a specific order and serve as the organizational structure of the scripture. The hymns within each Rāg are further classified by the specific Guru who composed them.</p>
        <p>Each Rāg in the <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib</a> has a specific significance and is associated with a particular time of day, season, or mood.</p>
    
        <h2>Purpose and Significance:</h2>
        <p>The use of <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> in the <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib</a> serves to elevate the spiritual experience of the recitation or singing of the hymns. The <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> help convey the emotions and spiritual teachings embedded in the hymns, making the message more impactful and immersive. The <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> also reflect the Gurus' deep understanding of the spiritual and psychological effects of music.</p>
    
        <h2>The Role of Kirtan:</h2>
        <p>Kirtan, the singing of hymns from the <a onclick="ScrollTO('guru-granth')">Guru Granth Sahib</a> to the accompaniment of musical instruments, is a central practice in Sikh worship. The <a onclick="ScrollTO('h1rag')">Rāgs</a> guide how these hymns are to be sung, ensuring that the music complements the spiritual message of the words. Traditionally, Kirtan is performed in a Gurdwara (Sikh place of worship), and the specific Rāg for a particular time or occasion is chosen to enhance the congregation's spiritual connection.</p>
